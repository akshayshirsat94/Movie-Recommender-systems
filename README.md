# Movie-Recommender-systems
Recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy or anything else depending on industries).

Types of Recommender Systems :

1) Content-Based Method :

Content-based filtering uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.

2) Collaborative Filtering :

Collaborative filtering models which are based on assumption that people like things similar to other things they like, and things that are liked by other people with similar taste.

3) Similar-User Filtering :

The method identifies users that are similar to the queried user and estimate the desired rating to be the weighted average of the ratings of these similar users.

4) Hybrid recommender : ( Not Completed )

Hybrid recommender systems combine two or more recommendation strategies in different ways to benefit from their complementary advantages.
